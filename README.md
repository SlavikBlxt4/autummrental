## Project Overview

The Car Rental Platform offers a user-friendly interface for users to search for available cars, make bookings, and manage their reservations. Additionally, employees have access to features for managing the inventory and bookings.

## Backend Implementation

The backend of the Autumn Car Rental is developed using Java, following a hexagonal architecture with layers for DAO, Service, Action, and Controller. PostgreSQL is used as the database for storing user and booking data. Passwords are encrypted using bcrypt for enhanced security.

## Frontend Implementation

The frontend of the Autumn Car Rental is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, following an organized architecture of Component, Repository, Service, and Main JS to ensure a structured and modular codebase.

## Key Features
